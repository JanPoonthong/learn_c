I want know what's these numbers are 0x7faa08c7f310

Some tutorial just teach you how to code, but not how thing work deeply inside

I want to learn how thing work on a computer

Step 1 is to learn C.

Step 2 is to read the source code

I want to know how code is ran, is it from ram or cpu?

Where does the variables stored in a computer?

I want to know how my code ran on the hardware and on the OS, not just python3 main.py

If you learn a programming language like C that forces you to manage your own memory, you will learn many of these other topics because they are critical. It will also make you a better Python programmer.

Gooligum board?

Read Python's source code (cpython).

For that particular piece, you probably need to understand C as well. cpython is written in C.

If you want to learn about the hardware, make an emulator.

If you want to learn about the OS, learn C.
